The preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pacin
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space and
Took the travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
And look how many  es piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my  s around
I gotta prove it right now waitin' for ‚Äòem to feel it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating

So impressive, she would this Beretta if I let her
Have a blast of a lifetime, ass of a lifetime
I swear this   I give her it'll last her a lifetime
A nice night selling hard rock in the pipeline
Put in their life and now they love a longtime
Wednesday three freaks, Thursday four hoes
Five on Friday, yesterday six chicks
Today is the Sabbath I got seven going at it
On a mattress doing you can't imagine, I'm laughing
True story, real talk, that's classic
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
Had to leave from home, better off than hell
Skip the town somehow I ended up in jail
Loved the jail, it was better in the cell
Did a little crime, too that never ever tell
Somewhat I'm partying the third partying
First she started gargling, and end up swallowing
And went to class too and got some knowledge
You  ing with the devil like she over popping him
She love the pills too she over popping em'
She's standing in the line, just to do the line
  is that fresher than a mother er
Tell me wanna with us
Frontline hands up,  s while we thrown dust
I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

Huh, que ser√°, ser√°, so the story goes
On and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute
Tours and shows and groupie whores
Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot, though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room
That everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
Will he make it? Was it worth it?
Did he win? Will he survive? The Rodeo
Yeah

Ooh i'm wylin on 'em/

Gets in a car accident
Playing instrumental to "the ends"
Travis: Spoken
Dimness, my old brother
I can feel whispers flying over endless rain of meaningless chaos
Reality always exceed fiction
I can see an unborn generation
I can hear within the silence and see within the nothingness
Flashing neon lights trying to disturb and throw off my  ing judgment
Past, present, and future all melted in a nonending circle
Hear my words of temptation and redemption
They made me believe I could escape
Remember this  , remember me, the one who die here
It's time to live
Playing "coordinate"
Travis steps off the roof of an abandoned building to be found on the ground of an abandoned construction site
Playing "way back"
Playing "the ends"

Yeah, you get what I'm saying, you wanna marry 'em, you gotta marry my  s, you mean? Tell that I said shut the up, sit down, and pour up
 
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and my homies
It's quite enormous, my dinosaurus
You're my tourist, come be my tourist
I bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist
12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My   enormous
Fightin' the mood
Breakin' the rules, howl at the moon
Yellin' my blues, wanna hit snooze
Chase it with booze
I'm out in the noon, she out in the nude
Fightin' the fumes, it's hotter than June
I'm under the moon followin' you
I'm out of my head, I'm out on the road
It's nowhere to go, I gave you my soul
Am I right, am I wrong?
Tryna get home
The love, I'm up in the hill
My high's as low as a hill
High's as low as a hill

No, you can't say if I'm mad or not

What would you do if you heard I got it going on?

Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)

You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film

Where the weather is warm
Moonlight move when a dance
Peep a steeze from a stance
Had to leave home wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
 s give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a can't choke
When they recognize a real still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real  s sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed in the cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular  , come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout  
It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can't be realer, me and my  s in the villa
She in that white dress it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my

Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
I'm headed to the moon 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you  ed up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that  
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a and I'm doing my dance
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon

Midnight awakin', hyper ventilatin'
Drunk laps runnin' 'round the globe wild goose chasin'
After three number one albums woulda thought I'd feel amazin'
Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
Still rollin' up swishas
Now its beamers double parking, payin' the meter
In your club, on your couches, got paid to be here
On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us, only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Around 3 AM, dawg
I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
Bad mamacita, Miami Heat her, put her in a two-seater
Too bad I couldn't three-peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper
House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter
With more stamps than a skinny  , got tats on my visa
I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it, I mean
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
I might 'round, lose my mind

Now it's a party, yeah, it's a garden, let's get it started

Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects
Easy to me my  
Villa with a scene, youngin' always seen with a killer
Hand-stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela?
She even got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird  
From the corner put it on for the south? (Straight up)

When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it

You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these  es is  es and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow they act like they been down since day one
Where there's  in' tank guns
But  s never join the army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear I just done bought that mansion
Treat that like it's a dungeon
Up at 5 AM still workin', but I treat it like it's 1

Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed? No, broken phone
Retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him
I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes I threw a nut, but your friends a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about
Has he got enough weed? No
Broken phone, retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him
I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place

Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
(Cassette rewinding)
What, sucker free, what, what
I can do dat (I can do dat right there)
I can do dat, ay
If I spill drank on my clothes - I can do dat
It don't matter cause I buy me some more - I can do dat
I'ma spend about fifty in the mall - I can do dat
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall - I can do dat
I'ma stop weak  s from rappin'...
(Cassette rewinding)
I, can't, leave, drank alone
It got me feenin' (Feenin', feelin' good, Feelin' like a boss as I'm creeping through my hood)
(Car driving and speeding; tires screeching)
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn the devil stay testing and the devil wear Prada
(Just tryna go up the avenue)
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that's the they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing  s ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars
And looked with my eyes closed cause its driving me wild
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Oh yeah
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away
Dad: Junior!
Travis:  ...
Dad: Junior, turn that off!
Travis: Man, for what, shutup
Dad: What'd I tell you about playing' that loud ass music in this  in' house?!?
Travis:  !  in' drums crazy...
Sometimes I, Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I
Feel like I'm, feel like I'm (on the drive to the moon)
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada (Just trynna go up an avenue)
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
Be rockin' furs, look like copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that the they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing  s ridin' fours I just stared at the stars
Look with my eyes closed cause it's driving me wild
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
I hit the weed and just drive
Never  ed around so I‚Äôll be alright
And you can sit around here  ing with smaller minds than mine, live your life
She said the air is so clean
I think it was the codeine
But she thinks it's just trees
I like it when you stroke me
Eighteen, eighteen  
 , don't smoke all my weed
 , don't smoke all my weed
She likes to take LSD
Searching mathematical purity
Travel with security
Smokin' in the wind
Losing all my friends, smokin' in the wind
She said I'm feeling so lean, I think you called it codeine
Now her heads on their knees
I like it when you blow me
Eighteen, eighteen  
 ,  don't smoke all my weed
 , don't smoke all my weed
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'
I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose
I try it if it feels right (Oh)
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets brighter

Runnin' up an M, she come right back, I throw it back

Ashes, dust to dust
Death all on her mind, don't let her it up
 ing with these hoes make you put it up
At least Adam and Eve got to bust a nut
High of the blow just bought another nose
And I might pull off in that Ghost like where that go?
Doctor gave her double D's cause she heard a flow
Whoa, she move the aside cause he ain't important
She turn that
Cigarette to ash and watch it hit the dust
Girl quit playing yeah you know that boring
Not too many in leather pants that can with us
Now let us dance while I throw the dust
Ashes, to dust to dust
Know they all throw they hands cause they with us
So many  es bob and weave but they don't bob enough
Now these  es mad look what I done started up
Put that whip outside, I hit the key it started up
I told them kiss my ass while I hit the dust
I hit the weed then I hit the gas
So much gold you think a broke
So we gon' pull of trunk first so that you  s know
With an Irish centerfold but all she know is Adido
Damn my momma proud a made it out the moat
Where the sun always shine yeah but not no more
We party in the jungle till its time to go
So everybody rumble as they hit the floor
And if the world end it don't matter cause we bout to blow
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see
Driving 108 don't crash and hit the rail
Don't look deep in her eyes you might see hell
32 to 34 not that O'Neal
So many hours, after hours in hotels
What a crazy night, I ran away from home just to change my life
Remember when my  s told them owls came out at night
So now we bout to touch the sky, just to play in the night
Caught me standing now I'm in there standing, we staying the night
Daddy left but that never said goodnight
Man that wasn't right, now I want all the power
Expected a lot from that coward
And any second I'm bound to wow ya, all them beats I dealt
For like two years momma all them beats I felt
I can massage my own   I don't need your help
And I can crash my own whip, I don't need your belt
Tell me where the was you when I couldn't feed myself
And all that wack help me be myself
I swear I never
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see

We waited so long for this, to transform like I'm optimus
Monogamy for monogamous, ironically don't have time for this
The education brought scholarships
All the street taught us was to be streetwalkers
Full of hype and the life of a cheap talker
So tonight don't have no excuse not to take these offer
Now its time to make these suffer
Break out the bread and the wine and make E supper
Feel like a Pharaoh in his prime call that de-mumma
Momma, please don't trip on these trees at least none of these ya
In the mindset of the greatest
Put that I'm a young Houston legend in the making
Grab your cameras Ima photo to be taking
Let the lights down tell them pipe down
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off
All black blending in the night
X pound triple X style so profound Alana Fife
Secretary poppin' molly call it X-files
Think I'm in a daze I'm just feeling Blazed
Think I'm in a shape but I'm behind a maze
Funny you was amazed when you was getting laid
Me and my  s plotting now we getting paid
Giuseppe stilettos and Arabic Camaros
Everybody's fine no Robert De Niro
Why everybody do the line is my favorite hero
Guess I gotta find the time just to do the crime
She did a lot of crimes sleepy hallow time
Headhunter been up for hours doing head crunches
Stop using your head and go head and just learn something
But her head is only as strong as her bread damn it
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off

My momma always ask me 'bout my attitude
Damn, momma, I don't know at all
I met this chick who want to meet me at the avenue
I had a feeling we'd have a ball
She knows stars, I know that, she want cars, I want jets
She want to get eloped, but I don't know yet
Pick up my fur after sitting, hanging in the coat check
Give me calls, she pick me off, I didn't hit the door yet
Damn, I'm sorry, but that gon' be looking love sick
All on TV, crying to Maury, looking love sick
While I'm probably in the Rari, going Audi,  ing with molly
And we running on E, not the gas, but the molly
And she  ing with me so she came to have a party
Now she leaving with me, now you're love sick
Do you realize?
We all want these flashing light, oh
So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh
Dinner time, I'm dining out with a porn star
She remind me of home, L.A., our second home
See see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar
Conversation was long, how she landed from Rome
Yeah, she did
Later on that night I got her back to the crib
Kicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin
After all she got a little taste test of my kids
You know what, we used to dream about this
A couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies
Should of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies
Treated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me
Yeah, she did
Head so good, it ain't even cost me
Woke up, she gone, look what I lost
Sheepskin' and that (?)
Do you realize?
We all want these flashing light, oh
So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh
Yeah, lights out
Tidal wave
Lyrics are yet to be released
My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got to lose, that make me nervous
I got to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dupes, can't let them come through
I got to lose
Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake
I got to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got to lose, that make me nervous
I got to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dupes, can't let them come through
I got to lose
Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake
I got to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
And I never liked it, and I never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
And I never liked it, and I never liked them
You know what, we grew on
We go back like futons and coupons
We too bad, we too wild, we too young
Shake some, my  s gon' shake some
Fall through and break somethin'
Broad day, and take somethin'
Backwards, I've been livin' backwards
On my mattress, orgies on my mattress
Flashes, dreamin', havin' flashes
Dashin', hopin' I don't crash it
My Lambo gon' skrr, my crib ain't got service
I got to lose, that make me nervous
I got to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dukes, can't let them come through
I got to lose
Hold up wait, more to gain, more at stake
I got to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
And you never liked it, and you never liked them
And I never liked it, and I never liked them
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew
Steady with the crew, steady with the crew

M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-MI
Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
 es don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that prolly missin'
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas

Speedin', and damn I'm leanin' on a Kawasaki
In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic
'Cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women
And we all playin' hockey
Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
  up the flow, nothin' but fam 'cause  s be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then rack it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My Yeezy done taught me that
Young  s in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie  
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?
If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women
He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin'
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas

Lyrics from snippet
Somethin', somethin', somethin', ooh
Ooh-ooh, uh
With the braids be showin'  s breeze
Everybody...
I need a psychologist mo city fle-fle-flexologist (Straight up!)
Pornographic, shootin' on Metropolis, damn
Yeah, yeah, they down for the deal
Man, man, man, momma be trippin'
See Tony got the Jeep and I'm ready to whip it
Chase packin' the techniques, and we rockin' the Key Club
Roll up the dub, club showin' us love
You know nobody givin' a  , can't fit in the truck
All my homies is here, so tell me who rollin' with us
From Chicago to Houston, to NY, yeah, we do this
We bumpin' the music, so get drunk and get stupid
You know nobody givin' a 'bout (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too  in' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a about (Last night)
If you don't give a about (If you don't give a about)
Two twins and they naughty, they both ridin' shotty
It's a Friday and you know we ready to party
We hit the college in Malibu where it's hotties
They givin' us knowledge and while I'm drivin' they daddy's 'Raris
In the dark with no worries, we ain't in a hurry
I might just swerve and hit the curb (Skrrt)
We all too drunk to be scared (Skrrt)
Outta here, higher then the atmosphere
Yeah they ballin', but no Spalding
Make a killin', but no coffin
And when we make it, we gonna puke all over Vegas
And we were under the influence when we made this
So you gonna tell your DJ, "DJ DJ play this" (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too  in' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a about (Last night)
If you don't give a about (If you don't give a about)
Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too  in' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a about (Last night)
If you don't give a about (If you don't give a about)
It's the vendetta
No tarot cards, could tell me we trendsetters
Everybody out tonight, it couldn't have been better
Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders
We threw up our mom's dinner
So tell what you tryin' to do?
Me and my homies got the loot so we tryin' to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze, it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you think I could tell you 'bout last night? (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too  in' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a about (Last night)
If you don't give a about (If you don't give a about)
Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too  in' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a about (Last night)
If you don't give a about (If you don't give a about)

Lyrics From Snippet
...
Closet the mall, we buy whole thing
Big gas, it's lit, propane
One hit, one touch, La Flame
Been poppin'
Foldin' this money, can't make a knot, how not?
High on moon rock, jaw still locked
...
...
Far from this, I wrap me down, la migo
Yeah, far from this, I wrap it down, mami, oh
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Get a  , get a-
Baby (baby!), love
Baby, baby (know that I need 'ya baby)
You're my love
Baby (baby!), love
Baby, baby (know that I will need 'ya baby)
You're my love (know that I will need 'ya baby)
Late night, scrollin' through my call log
Had too much to drink, so I called ya
We been on an' off for a long time
How 'bout I come to your job and just spend time?
Damn, Goddamn, you always do it, damn
We get it at demand, got me thumbin' through them bands
I thank your momma for your damn features
Yo' ass on Pam, I swear I ain't lying, Gina
Thought that we would never talk again
'Cause you always call me up at the wrong time
Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (ooh-ooh-oooh)
Everybody love you, baby (oooh-oooh-oooh)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
Baby, love, baby (know I need you), baby, you're my love
You always call me up at the wrong time (baby)

Won't you come over an' just roll mine? (yeah, baby)
I'ma mix somethin' for the long drive home
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Wishin' I controlled time, wishin' I could do it
Wishin' for a long time just to set the mood in
We be goin' all night, but you just abusin'
Always had my phone line, but you never used it
Now you see me goin' up, now I'm glowin' up
I been, I been in that DB truck with my Courtney Love, ohh-oh
Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
Can only be you, can only be you
Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)

I just wanna spread my wings
Life ain't what it seems
Someone in this cruel world
Escaping through the night
Look into my night, my thoughts
Naked in this cruel world
Tears dripping on my pillow, thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window, if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these  s to understand
And what we  ing for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You can't blame a  , they tryna hang a  
I mean like every time a blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance unless she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same  s who was rolling with  s that was on E
Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon
The power of nature is such that it's what all art strives to be
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain‚Äôt what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
Last week was the last week
I turned my back and let my ass greet you
Dropped out and subtracted some  s
An' made more than my math teacher
Lookin' dead in the mirror, lookin' back how we did it
Makin' trips to them dealers, guess it paid off  
Sip this wine in fine clarity
Marijuana, the youth therapy
Swervin' on my old hoes that drove to insanity
I guess that was all straight out of vanity
To my kids, that was plan to be
That was all, the inhumanity
Life's an adventure, with a lot of action
Lucky I'm fresh, in the Dime fashion
A class act, called a class act
Funny, lookin' back, wonder where my class at
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain‚Äôt what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
(Fell out of love, feel like the Royal Rumble)
Fell out of love, feel like a Royal Rumble
Hard to be humble when you rock in the jungle
Stumblin', everybody was stumbled
In the den, left it in the vessel
Poor girl, ain't even the show girl
Blowjob, only your own job
She left off the Dawson's Creek
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain‚Äôt what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
Ooh

I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
Overnight just over night, I slipped into a cardiac
Slipped out my conscious don't know if I'm coming back, young maniac
Might go burn a roof, or what I'm supposed to do
Your rolling loner, walking living proof
A victim of the youth
Can I last one more hour?
Can you last one more night, cause I can make it
I ain't crazy, ain't need no doctor, I need patience
They be like "boy there, where yah been?"
I been and made it, swear I been ablazing, swear I been amazing
Godly feeling, bad  es, silicone-a-feeling
Let me cop a feeling, dream fulfilling
Tryna remix a million and build a building, gah damn!
I need that Neptune Estate that's out in the Hamps!
You know last night was so crazy, that went HAM!
Me and Archie, 10  es in a 2 seater
He can't remember  , and me either
Ahh!
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Dear brother
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay
I could stay in your mind
I could stay in your mind
She take a shot of Hennessy
I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Ros√©
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
'Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know  
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day; itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it
No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing:
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off
Falling off, never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right
(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right
(Oohh, ohh, oohh)
She take a shot of Hennessy

Falling off, falling off
(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right
(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right
(Oohh, ohh, oohh)
Now it's snap time, disrespectful rap time
Turn a flat line
Wannabe-trill  , nap time (Uh)
You feel me?
We don't want that here no more
Cause we don't wanna ride
I did it all on my own and I did it on time
No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing:
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off (Never catch me)
Falling off, falling off (Never catch me)
Falling off, falling off (Never catch me)
Falling off, falling off
(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right
(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right
(Oohh, ohh, oohh)
(Oohh, ohh, oohh)
Lyrics from Snippets
I'm up three, up three, check the news
Double cup and R√©my, that's the remedy for the blues
... yeah
We've been outside, we've been outside
Need to pull up to the crib for the stop by
29 I bust the line, no Rondo
Finna slide through, finna slide through
Yeah, don't make me come out just to find you
'Bout to make me go back to the low fade
...  might go, I might go
Yeah, I might go out there
I might go
Yeah, I might go Subie
I might go
Yeah, I might go Subie
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rock stars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, up  
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of Vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it up our mind
She let us smell the line, let it up our mind
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
Summertime was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told 'em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But motto, when her breasts out tell em take some  ing photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
Did you have the time of your life?

3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rockstars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, up  
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it up our mind X2
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey X2
Summer time was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But motto, when her breasts out tell em take some  ing photos
Fill up the dressing room with will&rich and kwazi motos
So we popped the champagne so drunk spilled liquor all over her vera wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here
White girls lying to their mum for the lines
Black boys do the crimes for the lines
You dealing or buying or you're way out of line
We be speaking to the tyrants that be twinkling and shinin
 es crying rivers cuz I left em behind
Got that liquor in my liver while I trip and recline
This keep callin but im clicking decline
We live in a time,where the in our mind
Is to get on our grind,im ruthless for the paper
I spit the truth in the booth,and I ain't care about a hater
Plus im getting high, got a pack of northern lights
My sword is bright,ive sworn to fight as the warrior night
To protect those who sold their souls over night
So if you get in our way you will get pulverized
Im a monster, you better run  
You lucky that the night is over, see you at sunset

Dodge a copper-opper cab will give a  
Go to class but not for the scholarship
Here's a different scholar she a dolly pouter
Here's a problem with my holy grail, ain't got no holy water
I'm too slonky, Tony hates this part about it
When the keys roll up the car, you can roll if you with it yeah, yeah
Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That is wack, them  s in the mall they sellin'
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla
Candy be keep tapping that hoe, we hopping that area code
Somehow, if they figure that Harry and Mary are bros
They end up just rocking the tote
Circles around, you be calling up everything gold
Them  s is southerners  s be rapping and popping
Not give a about those
The same ones giving me 5, is seeing me live
The girl they chilling beside, be giving me sage
She been tripping all night, thinking 'bout moving them boobies aside
Sneak in and out of the crib
But definitely, Holly committed to giving me rights
Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That is wack, them  s in the mall they sellin'
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla
Yo, yo, yo
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave,  , behave
 , behave,  , behave
Us  s, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young  s treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, " , get back in the door"
I've been comin' up and down, a can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin,  , you gotta get with it
My, my, my, my
Look at little Scotty now
The same  ers used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud
I pull my zipper down and whip it out
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade, in the third grade
Can't hide from the truth
Yeah, we're 'bout to go ape, we're 'bout to go ape
These streets is not safe
These  s ain't playin', these  s ain't playin' (huh)
These  s ain't playin'
This for my fam, this for the fam, do this for the fam
Hop out of the Lamb', hop onto the 'gram
What the was you sayin'?
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave, piss in your grave
I'll piss on your face
I'll piss on your  , I'll piss on your date (huh)
  is you sayin'? is you sayin'? is you sayin'?
Me and La Flame, is you not entertained?
Huh
Yap, yap, yap
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave
  behave
I can't behave, I'm down to rage, been up for days
They treat us like slaves, I'm tryna get paid
You  s tryna get paid
This that moment I been waitin' for
This the reason why I banded for
This the reason told my momma get back of the backin' board
Then the commas, the commas
And her son had started drama
Had these independent  es
Been up poppin', last a minute
Had a lot of all us in it, feel it
My, my, my, my, sippin', mixin' hypnotize
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave, piss in your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade, in the third grade
This one right here for the kids at the grade
In the third grave
How come you want it? Can't with the  
This one ain't fair, this one for family
This one the damn, this one I thank
That's when thought it was safe and it wasn't
Pointer me, Allah, some on your water
I'm callin' your mada, call on the collar
Piss On Your Grave, Piss On Your Grave, Piss On Your Grave, Piss On Your Grave, Piss On Your Grave
Can't let the president turn us to slaves!
They'll turn us to slaves!
Can't let the president turn us to slaves!
They'll turn us to slaves! Yeah yeah...
Piss on their graves, Piss on their graves
Everyone say school and grades, school and grades
Drop out of school and find out how to get paid, find a way to get paid
I bought a new chain, I piss on that grave, I killed my master, take a chain from the slave
Piss on that grave, piss on that grave, made it out of the cave
Piss On Your Grave, Piss On Your Grave, Kid Cudi told me to how just wait
Told me how to just get paid
Told me how to how to stay great
Piss on that grave, piss on that grave
Piss on that new grave...
Lyrics will be available upon release
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it (Straight up!)
Pop up on me, pop up on me
Pop up on me yeah, don't be late
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized with a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of "  this  "
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so you, and this
No monogamy, m√©nage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights‚Äî, lights‚Äî, lights‚Äî
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna  
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut
No monogamy, m√©nage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say "  you"
To the ones who say "  you"
'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La Flame, he hears in his head, "The world is yours" (Yours, yours)
Wake up,  , gotta get the cake up,  
 s in the bushes in the farms
Might gotta rake up a  
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us  s in the projects
Wonder why a went cold hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these  s how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe?  , no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
 s askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium
So wake up,  , gotta get the cake up,  
 s in the bushes,  s on the farm
Might gotta rake up a  
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world, hmm
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop
Never ever gonna stop it
La Flame says, "Let your ambition carry you"
No monogamy, m√©nage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna  
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut
No monogamy, m√©nage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy
Riding around in my old whip
Used to drive that thing like I stole it
I control the drop when you roll it
12 pull us over you'll hold it
You the coldest girl I been loving
You the hottest girl and you know it
I might just let you pour that for real yeah
Got a little, got a little trip
Got a little, got a little lift
Got a little, got a little lit
Man I woke up up in the middle of the night
And just fillin' up my backwood all up
As many extendos as possible
Money, money alcohol weed
Everything on me weed and the lab-anos
Got the diam-anos, angelos
You get it v√°monos
I gotta' know
One thing about you, I'm finna' menage you
You still give me time yeah you know, massage you
You might make me hide you, but
How you can but you know that you winnin'
You know what you wearin'
You know when you in it
Come with more hydro and NyQuil
More Xan than a Bicycle, you know that I roll it
Roll it you I'm rollin'  my pollie only from my coaches
 s know I remote control it
Money, it, I need money homie
Got that money comin' in, outta the spot
Got it hot, on lock as approaches
Hop in my whip we get coastal yeahhh
Got a little, got a little trip
Got a little, got a little lift
Got a little, got a little lit
Riding around in my old whip
Used to drive that thing like I stole it
I control the drop when you roll it
12 pull us over you'll hold it
You the coldest girl I been loving, for real
You the hottest girl and you know that
I might just let you pour that for real yeah
Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well up some  
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us
Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Pills (Pills, pills)
Have you ever been through life's (Through life's)
Challenges? Promises? Promises?
(Challenges? Promises? Promises?)
Get down, heartbreak (Get down, heartbreak)
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a had the locks (Just ask the lonely)
'Fore a had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my   longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that gotta blow
Pray for love
No, ooooh
We don't pray for love, no more, no more
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more
We don't wanna see you on the news, no more
All alone
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, yeah
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a tryna get paid
These  s fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she want to be wife
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax faster than a hi-hat
Sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a like me
My  s pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh, don't pray for love (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, say it loud (Oh, oh)
(Just ask the lonely)
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
(Just ask the lonely)
Lyrics from Snippet
Ooh, ooh‚Äö yah
Ooh‚Äö Jack
I deal with all kinds of pressure
I roll me some Godly lettuce
And build me a temple for it
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Where I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Yeah
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
When I lay up, need three of them when I lay up
Juggle my balls in a lay up
Way back in the back I‚Äôve been laid up
Flights been direct not a layover
Lately I‚Äôve been wanting to take a stewardess in the back
Bang, pow her, onomatopoeia
That double cheesey got ate up
 s counting and the day up
Did two months in the dirt, six double takers
Had to put work, double work for the pay up
(Straight up, La Flame)
That was easy now we laid up
Won‚Äôt stop until we get Ghost
They got a star, for err' night that we stayed up
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
Laid up
Straight up
Laid up
Straight up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,‚ÄÖyeah
Yeah,‚ÄÖyeah, yeah, yeah
Hilt‚ÄÖfor the shocker
Out the hilt, out‚ÄÖthe hilt, hilt
Out the, off the hilt
Drop it out the hilt, baby, drop it
On my  , 38 hoes on my  
Is it natural? Wide? Is it thick?
Checks in my pocket and my kicks, kicks
Took the risk, Rose-gold Patek on my wrist
If I pull up, pull up, is it lit?
Beepin' by the gate
I've been beepin' by the gate, I've been
Damn all these stars on my head
Okay, it's cool, keep this ice, keep me fridge
Chase hit the stu' with me, somethin' I can hear
You know I'm James in The Garden, I can't miss
Ooh-ooh, I been through it, let me vent
I sat back and watch 'em switch up from my side of the fence
Old  s makin' rules, tryna box young Scotty in
Live and die just by two codes: love your haters; no new friends
Find a way to let it fade from me by the sip
Take it down 'til I feel it in my ribs
She come right through, then I send her to the crib
Then she know, now she know what it is, yeah
On my  , 38 hoes on my  
Is it natural? Wide? Is it thick?
Checks in my pocket and my kicks, kicks
Took the risk, Rose-gold Patek on my wrist
If I pull up, pull up, is it lit?
Beepin' by the gate
I've been beepin' by the gate, I've been
Been Trill, mother er
Mike-WiLL Made It

Wake up in the mornin', throwin' on them Nikes
Runnin' through that check, shout my Phil Knight
Oreos in Oregon State, pop twenty pills in the night (ooh)
Goin' a thousand miles in another state
They ain't oreos but they bright (straight up)
Clap it break that back, she just made a stack (ooh)
 s in that trap still totin' them straps (that dope)
If you make it where I'm from
It's like a lone star in the sky that's all black (Been Trill, mother er)
A 'm√©nage √† trois' with black dykes, damn
That's the new civil rights (straight up)
Accidentally walked in the club, all these  es bite (ooh)
Told my mama a major, best decision my life (straight up)
Now  s in the corridor, I'm velvet down to my corduroys (La Flame)
Got bottles by the cases, by different races
I had to get her right
That changed my life (straight up)

Purp in my itch palms, red lips six inches long (Been Trill)
Took her like a hooker, now come get your Shaun
I left her outside, I left her mouth dry
Feed her to the mountain lions 'cause that try countin' mine
 ,  , you's a  -  (you just a  - )
You be doushin', I be pushin' ether
 , you  -boy cunt
Won't be satisfied 'til I see ya'll suffer in the sun
Chiefin' while I'm beefin', turn me odds to evens
My lawyers are some heathens
Beat it blowin' on some on reefers
If you didn't want a war, then why you'd wage it then?
I only wear jeans, I could fit a gage up in
I'm so high right now, look like I'm in Japan
Amazing, junkie jit came up major in
Trench team, ten deep, red beam, laser tag
Bring it, what you got?
Police and pistols don't phase your man
I had to get her right
That changed my life (straight up)
That changed my life (straight up)
That changed my life (straight up)
I had to get her right
That changed my life (straight up)
That changed my life (Been Trill, mother er)
That changed my life (straight up)
Look up at my eyes and I know you see a bad guy
Try to front on us, man, you better ask them last guys
Suicide doors pull up when we ride by
Goon  s hop up with guns a drive by
Smokin' weed on the jet,  , I'm fly high
You don't wanna give me neck?  , bye-bye
On to the next  , I hope she bi-bi
'Cause I love  es that love  es that love  es
I love  in' on they friends and I love  in' on they sisters
Bad  es roll my swishers, Goddamn, I'm that  
Smokin' on that reefer thinkin', "How can I get richer?"
Damn shawty bad like the old Detroit Pistons (damn)
Damn I wanna  , when I hit, I'm gettin' misses
Treat her like man its " -a-  feelings"
Money stacked tall, man, it's touchin' my ceiling
Money stacked tall, man, it's touchin' my ceiling
I had to get her right
That changed my life (straight up)
That changed my life (straight up)
That changed my life (straight up)
Holy moly, all them  s dead
All them pussies fed
Let 'em live? Meh
Young owl in the dark
Thought he'd make it, never
Do you hate 'cause they know I'ma be here forever ?(straight up)
Never with the black and blue
Duck cause a might shoot
Shocked what a might do
Young blessed like a ah-choo (bless up)
In the Mo they smokin' raw diesel
Evil Knievel whip pullin' off in the dust (skrrt, skrrt!)
Throwin' flame rocks when a might jerk (straight up)
Bouncin' this like it's tennis
Vitches still eatin' at Denny's
Hotels phones, I'm talkin' that business
Came up with the ones that was with me
Besides,  , your  s facade,  
She off shoe with that Snooki
Don't fall in love with that (straight up)
I had to get her right
That changed my life (straight up)
Been Trill, mother er
Shit I got like...

And I'm off Atlantic, 2-1 rob 'em, bumbaclot,  
Not a P-O-K, I'm out for the VS

Use piff, short words for the loose girls
All mine's re-up, y'all regret
Don't worry 'bout my team, my team is set
Don't worry 'bout T, it's in-depth
When it comes to the motha in' c-notes
We'll start us a motha in' glee club

Man, here it go, fishcale, A1 perico
Fill PJ's up with kilos, then sell it like it's legal, yeah
Everybody he know, could have gotten hit with the RICO
Caught a couple of charges, they were weak though
Feds had to let him go in a week or so
Still, still need the key to blow
Whole heap of dough, ran the streets for so long
Man the team was so on, damn it seem like so long
Ago, we had 'em in Mexico
He tryna' make it back, three bricks more
The people always run up on us in Texas though
Only by the grace of God they ain't catch us though
Some lil' young with some big dreams
Almost on the verge of doing some big things
Tryna' get a bird since he was sixteen
And now he playin' ‚Äòround with fifteen or more, ayy
You know a love nice things
And the price in the hood is too frightening
Them  s ain't gon' do the right thing
It‚Äôs time for me to do my thing (Hey)
Finessin', finessin' (Straight up)
I can't go one day without finessin' (La Flame)
Finessin', finessin' (Bando)
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessin' (Straight up, straight up)
Finessin', finessin' (Straight up)
I can't go one day without finessin' (La Flame)
Finessin', finessin'
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessin' (Straight up, straight up)
How high?
Tell me why she wanna leave me?
She used me to get high
Oh she used me to get higher, higher, higher
So tell me why she wanna leave me?
Ooooh, ooooh, oooh, ooh-oooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
As the days go on, the southern region of our national anthem
The quest for La Flame, this journey, it's the last days

Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex

When you leave, I think about it, damn, I need it (I need it)
Johnny Cochran on these hoes the way I beat it (I beat it)
You make me weak, but don't mistake it for my weakness
I've been out here, I've been out here with your deepest
Automatic, going in, I'm going T-Rex

I'm gonna let you know the move
I'm gonna take you on a cruise
I'm gonna take you home and screw
(Southside)
And that's all I've been sayin' (Southside)
If you fall for the games then you're the one playin'
Because it's too much money out here
And there's too many honeys out here
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Droptop with the windows up
Jump inside, oh, won't you roll with us?
Make the devil bite the angel dust
Shawty got a thing for us
Shawty what you want
Tell me what you like
Tell me what you want
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly, yeah
I just took a four to the head like "man"
Drop the top on the slab like "man"
Off the top of the dome like "man"
Nothin' beatin' home like "man"
In the Screw tape zone like "man"
I go Pimp C on the phone like "man"
Flip say platinum, don't do chrome like "man"
Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang
This S.U.C smooth like "man"
Rest in peace Screw like "man"
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Drop top with the windows up
Screw found international sound because‚Äî
Throughout the South, and it's new to, um...
Shawty got a thing for us

Wonderin' what we did last night
I'm pretty sure it was wild
Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild
10 am, it‚Äôs Ransomnia
She see the dust, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight, we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
  the streetlights, she ran the street tight
She run her mouth, but can't eat right?
Don't read between the lines and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby, you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
The Rollie on me only 'cause to tell what the time is
We lost in the city where sin is no biggy
I'm in the backseat searching for my memory
Wonderin' what we did last night
I'm pretty sure it was wild
Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild
After hours, seconds turn into minutes
They like, "We finished", but this just the beginning
We in a arms race off‚Äì
She ripped the soul out, tell me how that bar taste
In this life, see, we could have a hell of a life
I mean I, these days been a hell of a sight
I'm so twisted, so I around and forgot my is
We set trends for young  s'  s to follow
I'm in the backseat searching for my memory
Wonderin' what we did last night
I'm pretty sure it was wild
Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild

Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime (Woo, yeah)
Got me goin' crazy
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds
(Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed
(Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that forever, she on both knees

They keep itching at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (Yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (It's lit)
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (Yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Alright)

Then a storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees (Straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime (Woo, yeah)
The trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones
All gathered in secrecy and flying high as a kite
Hmm, hmm, (Stop tryna be God) (God)
Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This way too big when we pull up give me the loot
(gimme the loot!) Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mix this pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
Some‚Äîsome‚Äîsome, someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl‚Äîpl‚Äîplayin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl‚Äîpl‚Äîplayin' for keeps, don't play us for weak
No, no, no, no, no
This way too formal, y'all know I don‚Äôt follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my es√©s, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her "hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305,  es treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that  !)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said "where we goin'?" I said "the moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this together? I'm the glue (Domeone said)
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl‚Äîplayin' for keeps
Someone said, mother er‚Äîsomeone said
Don't play us for weak
Rest in peace the queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, ASTROWORLD number one, right now, VMAs, make some noise! Yessir!
This is the real action: the pot party, the trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones
All gathered in secrecy and flying high as a kite
Hmm-hmm
Just know what this about
Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Palm trees, oceans, fresh air, that can break your heart
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)
Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God Almighty
  the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (Ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)
The signal's far from what you can be (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)
Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' my whole life
I'm warning you, best not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love but want to really burn me
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)
Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still, still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
That it?

You know I had to hit up Johnny Dang (bling, bling bow, bow)
Ya, ya, I need that ice ah√≠, I need that ice ah√≠

Smash everything in Aces now we off to Follies (ooh)

Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down
I know some young  s from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar
I coulda went to school to be a doctor
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop
Still on a paper chase that don't never stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Sremmlife!
Know some young  s like to swang
Know some young  s like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Diving a hearse, I dive and I curse
I dive at my worst, we dive and we lurk
Out on the scene, blowing on green
Denim my jeans, Molly you know where they're seen
Margiela dipping, I coast, I'm out on the boat
We freestlye,  s is spitting rhymes off the throat
I'm moving, I'm scheming moving, I'm dodging and grooving
Sway in the Morning, ain't losing
IPhone 6, I'm chirping and lurking the scene
You know I get it, blowin' I'm blowin' that mean
Mr. So Clean, no bald head the dreads never, the braids whether
You  s out here changing the weather (rain)
My dollar bills are hundreds and fifties, no twenties
Tens, I never get it, money is plenty
On a billion dollar mind scheme, on the rhyme scheme
You know La Flame doing a hundred damn five things
Dressed here, with the retro, might pull up on your show Trillelectro
Might hit the Amsterdam with the mess low
La Flame coming through, with the next flow
I'm looking at the dash, it's 12:06
I'm looking at your girl, thats my  !
You took her out now, she living with (me)
I ain't rolling through, with written  
This is straight flow, waking up at the 9AM, blowing dope
  like me, I'm blowing smoke
Hotel at my door, like "you gotta go,"
I ain't leaving 'til 4, yeah you gotta know
Free the Snowman, free my Meek Milly
He the first showed me duffle bag with millie
  put me in a Bentley, blowing Philly
Had me out in Philly, after Wet Willies
Took 'em to Miami, took 'em to damn Diddy
Out on the boat rolling, I'm sipping on wet willies
Once again no Ciroc, I'm moving, I'm moving good
Shout my Ye, we all G.O.O.D
Shout my T.I, the Hustle Gang good
Shout my  s, NY, I'm blowing Backwoods
You know how we get it, I'm kicking it freestyle

Almost frozed on me
Yeah I know
Na-na-na-now that can't let me go
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that crazy
I dozed off in this cabin
Damn, I woke up barely breathing
Damn, I can't believe what I'm seeing, from last weekend
We all met up for drinks and
She standing same coat, still chiefing on that pinewood
I'm tryna' figure how I end up in these dry woods
About as high as I was, no clothes and I'm tied up
Look like life or death, and she staring me in eyes
So I had to wipe my eyes cause this ain't gone fly
So I had to go, broke out then I clocked out now it's time to roll
Should have know I shouldn't have boned but I had the dough
When I pulled out all the weed she pulled out the blow
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that crazy
We took trips down to Marrows even shopped up at Meadows
She moved straight out the ghetto cause she deep down in that hell hole
Scholarships, daddy even let her drive all kind of whips
That's why I hear tire screeching
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
I feel like she right behind me
But that ass might be outside
See all this gold right behind me, now that ain't no mirage
And she crazy like she Fonzy cause I won't have no menage
When I see me on the concrete man I swear I almost died
Somehow I jumped straight out my car seat not even I parked that outside
That had me running down a dark street
How I made it out alive I don't know I must be slonky
How I know, now now I know
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that crazy
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights

She need to borrow right now, yeah
I wrapped the money, flew it like a kite to H-Town, yeah
Now we on now like the light bill, but never cuttin' off, yeah
I'm on top now, still comin' down, but never fallin' off, yeah
I might need the distance, all I need is time, time
Can't even look at my phone line
Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply
But they know my name, they compare it, still
We was busting seals before we had a mil'
We done had the grills before we had a deal
I'm a Houston  , that's what made me here
That's the curse, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
But your momma always taught you put in work
Put in work, yeah, put in work, yeah
Yeah! Yeah!
They might hit you with that Tyga, never do you right
Hit you with that Bill Cosby, thirty  es overnight
I might have to hit my back up, hit that 713 side
I might have to pull a Tiger, I might have to crash my ride
Can't be like you  s, no, can't be like you guys
I can't tell no stories, no, I can't tell no lies
All we do is money, do that money exercise
We just pay our taxes, pay our tax, don't pay no mind
That's the worst
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah, yeah
Yeah! Yeah!

One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me

Cookin' on a tune, I've been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat
(Back seat, back seat, back seat, back seat)
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet

Gotta watch my back now, 'cause these  s at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on ya
They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends
Let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends
From a tribe of check-a-hoe like Indian
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh-hey
To them I'm a big  , a cheque and some laughter (Hahaha)
I guess it's all survival but please be careful, uh
I gave up on the Bible long time ago, uh
Oh, I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know, ha
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids, hmm
And dumped 'em in the creek up from where I live (Ayy)
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around (Uh, uh)
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza, uh
And said he had a label recruitin' people (Uh)
Put that on my grandma and everything, yeah
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me, it could've been you too
But what a memory in me, it may need interludes (Could've been me)
What's gon' patch up my inner tube
So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too
Oh yeah, La Flame with the nappy fro now, yeah

You  ing nut, you acting ass, they laugh at us
Stupid  , you  ed it up, is over why you toss the dust
With a mask on, when I looked at you I hope they pray for us
Hand-tied to the sky, wonder how a living so high
Is it cause the lights on me? It always rains on me
When I first came home, I was in the feds, they took my kids, homie
Living in a lie homie, man, the devils alive, will I ever survive? I never die, homie
Never knew in my life that I would step into fire
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Did it all for a little, did it all for my  s
Shine hard for the  es, put a mask on for the pictures
Different know from my homies, talk like you don‚Äôt know me
Damn its gonna cost tomorrow, all them drunk flicks you wanna show me
Funny how we back here, all my fam here
Twisting up while we rolling up with a wine glass on a glass pier
Went from sleeping at Tony home, moving back to where I was grown
Trippy how
A lifestyle makes me live my life wrong
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute (oh yeah)
Do it
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds
First order of business, I gotta fly out my people
Way too many fakes in my face, I can see the evils
Drug addictions, bad  es
They gotta be chose, see the peacoat
Black slacks, it's R.I.P. clothes, see amigos
Laid back, I cock the nino, game time, gang time
No time to reload, handle mine, take mine
I've gotta deebo, can't waste a minute
Rap Yeats, I master business, but still a menace
Peep my mojo I got together, I'm in my bag
Too many looks, they pocket watchin', gotta hit the gas
Look back, I see the clouds, these  s doubt
They say a  'd never make it, now look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hood times, I never cared, I pull up there
Outside your club, I'm at your club (yeah)
And I gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many

You know that I miss it, don't be shy
You know that, you know that
I don't go that way
How many times the merry-go-round goes around
You come around a whole lot of times
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty  es walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my  ? Damn it feel great (woo)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist

La Flame killin' you,  s, damn, I'm sorry (damn, I'm sorry)
That's not my kid, call up my  , Maury ( , Maury)
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom and I'm stickin' to that story

Pull up in Manhattan with thugs,  
Up Up Up Up
Up Up Up Up
Up Up Up Up
Up Up Up Up
Let the mink drag on the floor
She snorting the 70s dope
Up in the ghost she said she need it the most
Quit tripping we having a toast
Step in and out the plane
She act like she Marilyn Monroe
All on the boat showing her boobies the most
Lets toss her and see if she float
We pulled over the car at the liquor store
And if these  es ain't fresh as me, then what we in here for?
Simply, That wild, Let that go
Easily, just roll up the dope and watch me turn it to smoke and go
Up Up Up Up
Up Up Up Up
Up Up Up Up
Up Up Up Up
Twenty to thirty trill hippies they circle around me
With skin leggings they rocking Marants, but they smoking for free
It's funny ain't it,  es is destined to be
Living the dream, while you out chasing these hoes
She probably taste-testing my seeds
Ooooh, that's why we never sleep
It's primetime
When I'm on the phone I'm talking O's
So It's buy time
When I'm on the road turn the lights on
Cus' It's my shine
So all these strobe lights and bulb lights got me

No magic trick, but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great

I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati; next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink,  
We have bust down Rollies, bust down Piguets
And I told him I needed him to bust down our new baby

Who that? Who that? I don't with these  s
Piss me off, ho, I might pull the trigger
Know what I'm sayin', know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I'm sayin'?
Heard they talkin' 'bout I
Who, what, when and why? (Who?)
I'm alive, just took one to revive (Yup)
Keep that vibe when we show up and collide ('Llide, yeah)
Me and the guys move just like the F-O-I (Ooh)
In the Hills, but still keep them ghetto ties (Hills, yeah)

We took the crib, flood the backyard like it's the beach (Drip, drip)
We did some things out on the ways that we can't speak
All I know it was "Mo Bamba" on repeat (Cash)
I don't think these things I took is helpin' me (Oh yeah)

Lifted, I'm feeling so gifted, tripping, I'm constantly falling
Channel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie whipping the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
 es don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, since she's lamping with the trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your  es might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I don't miss it
World found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that prolly missing
La Flame

Difference between me and him is he gon' run from you
And I'm never gonna run, I'ma gun at you
Hundred K for the teeth got some gum on you
Cause my wife is too bad she the bomb on you
Baby suck that   until it cum on you
And I'ma suck that put some lung on you
She gon' draw down with me got you runnin' too
Just for that I might put a son in you
Put a thirty piece right in my bomber too
Quarter milli she know that she stuntin' too
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (Yeah!)
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks (used)
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S
La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CC's you ain't seen yet

You can't try none the brothers, the brothers try you (Yeah)
If you try one of us you get put on the news (Yeah)
Pull up in that new Bentley truck, I didn't come here to lose
Made it to clearport, forgot to say she had a dude
Bag full of money and all of these hunnids is blue
I know you proud of me, A.P., I don't do apologies
High tune on my Prada tee, purchase on my new AMIRI jeans
Young Gunna drip god, I fly with no wings
I let her use my card to secure her needs (Yeah)
Had to tell her girl these pearls, not beads (Yeah)
Gettin' high in the sky without my weed
